# `06` Listening for events

Events in React work pretty much the same way they do in Vanilla JS: if you want to listen for the user's `Click`, all you have to do is add your `onClick` property (or any other event) to the HTML tag, as it is usually done.

The current code has one component that prints `I was clicked!` to the console when clicked.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Update the `<Alert />` component to listen to the `onClick` event with the `handleClick` function correctly, and then check the console.

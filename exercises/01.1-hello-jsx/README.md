# `01` Hello JSX

JSX also allows you to easily include variables into your HTML. For example, let's assume that you have the following variable available:

```js
let age = 12;
```

If you want to include the value of that variable dynamically into your HTML code, you can do it like this:

```jsx
let output = <span> James is { age } years old </span>
```

Note the position of the curly brackets `{` and `}` wrapping the variable.

Then, we can render everything in the website content using `ReactDOM.render` like this:

```jsx
// Use react-dom to render it into the DOM
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
               //render output      //inside the innerHTML of #myDiv
ReactDOM.render(output,             document.querySelector('#myDiv'));
```

The resulting website HTML document will look like this:

```html
<div id="myDiv">
    <span>James is 12 years old</span>
</div>
```

Basically, we are now able to mix HTML and JS in the same file without having to concatenate and use strings.

 üòÉ  Amazing!... Right?  üò†

The app.jsx file has a variable called `name` that can contain a name.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please include that variable inside the `output` variable. Replace the hardcoded word `James` with the `name` variable (remember the curly brackets `{}`).

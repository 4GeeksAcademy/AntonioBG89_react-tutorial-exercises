# `05` Adding styles to the components

The most recommended way to do styles on React is using CSS-in-JS.

Basically, you create an object with your styles like this:

```jsx
const mySuperStyles = {
    color: "blue",
    fontSize: "14px",
    border: "1px solid black"
};
```

And then you can apply those styles to your HTML like this:

```jsx
<div style={mySuperStyles}>I am an alert</div>
```

##  üìù Instructions:

1. The current exercise has an object with styles applied already, please update the styles to the following:

    + Font size has to be `16px`

    + Background color has to be `black`.

    + A yellow solid border with `1px`.
